A rapidly expanding, award winning digital agency are currently seeking a full-time, frontend developer focusing primarily on JavaScript, to become part of a growing, young and ambitious team based in the centre of York. With clients including Uber, Jaguar Landrover, BBC, Leeds University, Hiscox and YourParkingSpace, the work we produce is at a high quality and scalable.

Our passion, talent and overall company culture has enabled us to nurture and inspire growth at both a personal level and overall company size, allowing us to double in size year on year.

We are also committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment and are proud to be an equal opportunities employer. We welcome any candidates who are qualified for the role, and ensure they are considered for employment without regard to any protected status.

## The role:

We are looking for an experienced developer who is able to step into high-quality, bespoke systems with JavaScript-heavy UI elements, whilst using frameworks such as React and Vue.js to interact with backend APIs.

We are looking for someone who is dependable, committed and continuously strives to improve their skill set and broaden their knowledge. In return you will get;

- A competitive salary
- A company wide perk scheme
- Regular team activities and afternoons off
- ‘Beer Fridays’ every week in the office
- Use of the office pool table and games consoles
- Flexible working hours and the ability to work from home when required
- Open-ended holiday allowance - and Christmas won’t count as part of it!
- Optional pension scheme
- Regular opportunities to attend conferences and training courses

If you think you’d be a good fit - read on to see who we’re looking for! Don’t worry if you don’t have experience in all of the skills listed, we are open to a wide range of candidates with all levels of ability.

## We’re looking for someone who:

- Has experience using JavaScript frameworks - React/Angular/Vue to name just a few
- Takes pride in what they do - an attention to detail both visually and technically
- Has strong HTML and CSS skills - including CSS preprocessor knowledge such as LESS or SCSS to make their life that much easier
- Can employ responsive development best practices to allow what you build to work across a range of devices
- Utilises open source packages effectively - using package managers such as npm
- Have used some sort of collaborative source control - we use git, but Mercurial and SVN are a step in the right direction

## But it would be good if you:

- Are up to date with the latest development best practices - knowledge of ES6 features and other emerging technology
- Have used Bootstrap in some form - we integrate it as a library within our LESS/SASS workflows rather than using the raw classes
- Have experience bundling tools - ideally Webpack, but Grunt or Gulp will also be beneficial
- Can build performant Single-Page Applications - experience with NEXT/NUXT would be ideal
- Give back to the Open Source community - instead of complaining about something that’s broken or you wish existed, why not get involved?
- Have a passion for testing - both manually as you code and automatically via unit testing
- Have touched on backend technologies before - Node and PHP are great!

## Developer skills aside, we would love someone who:

- Has good communication & team working skills - interaction between team members (and occasionally clients) is crucial
- Is able to self-manage - whilst working on a small, project manager led team
- Understands the client’s goals and aspirations for their project
- Is willing to continue to learn about new tools, languages and practices
